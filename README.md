# Yo! ðŸ¤™

I like to write lines of tech that make the web go brr. I currently work at [Adalo âœ¨](https://adalo.com) building the future of no-code.

I like coffee, cats, music and mechanical keyboards. If you would like to discuss these things feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zachbharris).
